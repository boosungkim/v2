I was encountering an issue that was resolved when I reset and re-ran everything. I used Scikit-learn’s Logistic Regression model and got an accuracy score of 86.11%.</p> <p>At first, I thought nothing of it. But when a friend congratulated me on finishing my first ever data science pipeline from scratch, I realized this was another yet another milestone. Yes, I completed Chess AI a few weeks ago, but that was using hardcoded algorithms. The EGR1 classifier is my first ever pipeline using legitimate data science/machine learning tools.</p> <p>Now that I realize the significance of the result of 86.11%, I can’t help but feel a little proud. Even if the number isn’t the best, this marks the point where I went from watching hours of lectures to programming hours of machine learning code.</p> <p>Time to optimize my model!</p> <p>To learn more about the EGR1 Binary Classifier, read here.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[EGR1 Binary Classifier]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sticky business of setting up a web server</title><link href="https://boosungkim.com/blog/2020/sticky-business-of-setting-up-a-web-server/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sticky business of setting up a web server"/><published>2020-12-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://boosungkim.com/blog/2020/sticky-business-of-setting-up-a-web-server</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://boosungkim.com/blog/2020/sticky-business-of-setting-up-a-web-server/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="0-introduction">0: Introduction</h1> <p>Earlier this week, I finally finished setting up my web server and decided to write this “documentation.” Looking back now, these steps may seem evident, but it was a nightmare when I started up due my complete lack of prior experience. I hope that this will be of use, whether it be to my future self setting up another server or to someone else starting from scratch.</p> <p>I used NameCheap for the domain name, Vultr for a VPS, CertBot for SSL, CloudFlare for the DNS servers, and the classic LAMP (Linux Apache MariaDB PHP) stack to host my web server.</p> <p>I only mention the major steps in chronological order to serve as a general overview of creating a web server from scratch.</p> <h1 id="1-basic-html-and-css">1: Basic HTML and CSS</h1> <p>Before anything else, I first had to write the foundations of my website in HTML and CSS. I found the Interneting is Hard tutorial to be the most intuitive.</p> <h1 id="2-purchasing-a-vps-and-a-domain">2: Purchasing a VPS and a domain</h1> <p>Purchasing a domain name and a VPS was easy enough. I decided to go with the popular choice of (first name)(last name).com. After I obtained a VPS, I set the A NAME for my root domain boosungkim.com and the CNAME for my subdomain www.boosungkim.com. This way, people will be directed to my site regardless of their URL choice. At this point, I was using the default NameCheap DNS servers.</p> <h1 id="3-setting-a-lamp-stack">3: Setting a LAMP stack</h1> <p>I believe that this is probably the section that took the second longest time to figure out. After I set up Debian on the VPS and installed Apache2, I still had no idea how to configure the Apache settings. I ended up jumping back and forth among several documentations and guides, but I mostly used these two: <a href="linux.com">Linux.com</a> and <a href="apache.org">apache.org</a>. The guide only shows the basic configuration of publishing an HTTP website, so I had to make alterations later on.</p> <h1 id="4-file-uploading-with-rsync-and-ssh">4: File uploading with rsync and SSH</h1> <p>Up to this point, it seemed like everyone was using some sort of graphical interface to upload their files. Since I did not have access to any, I originally considered pushing and pulling via GitHub. Thankfully, I figured out a simpler solution: I used the Linux command rsync over SSH. It was direct and fast.</p> <h1 id="5-ssl-https">5: SSL (HTTPS)</h1> <p>Now this is the part I got stuck on for the longest period of time, which was quite surprising. The vast majority, if not all, of the tutorials state that CertBot is simple to use. It certainly is easy to download, but the configuration process was convoluted for me as a beginner.</p> <p>At first, I made the mistake of getting the default certbot, which is designed for websites with only one domain. In the earlier part of this documentation, I mentioned that I had a subdomain for www.boosungkim.com. The subdomain and the default certbot conflicted, and I ended up completely destroying my web server. I had to reset the VPS and start all over again.</p> <p>After the restart, I realized that I need to use the wilcard certbot to install HTTPS for all the subdomains as well as the main one. I then immediately faced the issue of DNS plugins—NameCheap does not support certbot, as they have their own SSL service (which is charged). A comment on a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/84no8z/lets_encrypt_certbot_namecheap_and_tlssni_or_dns/dvqz8pz/">forum</a> inspired me to switch to the CloudFlare DNS servers and use their plugin to install HTTPS.</p> <p>After the successful installation, I had to reconfigure my VirtualHost file to change from the HTTP port (80) to the HTTPS port (443). I followed the following <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HTTPD/ExampleVhosts">guide</a>.</p> <p>While these may seem like straightforward issues with effortless solutions, I can promise you that when I had no idea what was going on, understanding the core complication was like finding a needle in a haystack, except that the needle thankfully left a trail of clues here and there.</p> <h1 id="6-rss-and-the-email-subscription-system">6: RSS and the Email subscription system</h1> <p>Creating the RSS for my blog was quite a relief, as it was near trivial compared to the SSL mess right before this step. I used the documentations <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_rss.asp">w3schools</a> and <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html">FEED validator</a>, and you can view my XML file on my website as well.</p> <p>I decided to use PHPList for the email subscription system, because it uses PHP and mariaDB. I installed an SMTP client on my server, then the PHPList software. While the official <a href="https://www.phplist.org/manual/books/phplist-manual/page/installing-phplist-manually">PHPList documentation</a> includes a part of the installation process, it skims over the configuration of the database. I would recommend this resource here: <a href="https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-install-phplist-on-a-centos-7-vps/">Rosehosting</a>.</p> <h1 id="7-completion">7: Completion?</h1> <p>And that was the final major course of action I had to take. The current version of my website, “version 1” as I like to call it, was completed this Wednesday (2020/07/01).</p> <p>As mentioned, I did not include all the minor difficulties I had, such as granting different files various permissions, creating a contact form, and configuring the php file, but most of those were resolved by reading the documentation (often for hours).</p> <h1 id="learning-how-to-troubleshoot">Learning how to troubleshoot</h1> <p>Perhaps this is a stretch, but I believe that I learnt the basics of troubleshooting. To look up a problem, I had to narrow down what the scope of the issue. No search results came up when I simply said that my website sometimes showed up an error page. I had to specify the error messages and try to derive the main issue from them. Did I make a mistake in the Apache configuration file, or is port 443 closed? Perhaps it is the firewall? Oh no, I simply misdirected the website root folder.</p> <h1 id="the-future">The future</h1> <p>As mentioned, I consider the current website only Version 1.0. There are many more changes I would like to make over the next few months and even years. For one, I would like to automate the blog posting process. Right now, I have to code 5 times every time I post: the standalone blog file, the blog index page, the blog rolling page, the XML file, and the email. It would be far more convenient to have a single script that would code all that for me.</p> <p>But I leave my website where it is for now, as I would like to work on other projects before the summer ends.</p> <p>I hope this helps someone and thanks for reading!</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/boosungkim/original-website">The front end code</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[the process of setting up my original website]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The official start of my AI journey - walking before running</title><link href="https://boosungkim.com/blog/2020/the-official-start-of-my-ai-journey/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The official start of my AI journey - walking before running"/><published>2020-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://boosungkim.com/blog/2020/the-official-start-of-my-ai-journey</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://boosungkim.com/blog/2020/the-official-start-of-my-ai-journey/"><![CDATA[<p>For the past week or so, I have been trying to get started with my first Machine Learning project- the 4D Snake AI.</p> <p>The 4D Snake AI is based off of the 4th dimentional Snake game made by Pella86. I chose this project in particular for two reasons: 1) I really enjoyed the 4D Snake game, and 2) I kept seeing machine learning projects regarding the normal 2D version of the Snake game. I figured that I could follow along a tutorial project about the 2D snake, and I could expand upon that project and build a 4D Snake AI.</p> <p>Although I had never studied ML before, I thought to myself, “Hey, I didn’t know how to set up a web server and networking configurations and still managed to do it. Maybe this will be the same!”</p> <p>Unfortunately, that did not work very well. Obviously, without a basic understanding of ML and related Python libraries, I cannot complete the project unless I copy the vast majority of the code from someone else’s project. But where is the fun in that?</p> <p>Thus, I decided take my time and learn the basics of Machine Learning. A friend of mine recommended a textbook, <u>Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras &amp; TensorFlow</u>, which I will complete before moving onto bigger projects. I tried to at least make a headway in the original project so that I could write a blog post about it last week, but that sadly did not happen. Hopefully I can finish the textbook soon and make speedy progress on my project in no time!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[the beginning]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Blog 0 - Why I started a blog</title><link href="https://boosungkim.com/blog/2020/why-i-started-a-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blog 0 - Why I started a blog"/><published>2020-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://boosungkim.com/blog/2020/why-i-started-a-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://boosungkim.com/blog/2020/why-i-started-a-blog/"><![CDATA[<p>So this is my first official blog post of this website! I have to admit that setting up the basics of this web server was a lot more complicated than I anticipated, but here we are!</p> <p>On this site, I plan to post mainly about Math and Computer Science, my two great passions and also my majors. I will upload my opinions on various technologies, documentations I write while working on personal projects, and even potentially devlogs for particular projects.</p> <p>The primary reason I started writing about the my Math and Computer Science endeavors is to practice my communication skills. Up till now, I have worked on my technology skillsets, but not so much on communication. I realized recently that I should be able to convey my ideas in a clear and concise manner—even to people who may not be familiar with technologies I work with. Like most things, the best way to better my interpersonal skills is to practice.</p> <p>While that may be my main reason, I am already learning far beyond just communication skills: I learnt how to set up a server, the basics of the LAMP stack, and more. More on that on the next blog post about setting up a web server.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[my motivation for starting a blog]]></summary></entry></feed>
