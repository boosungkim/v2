## Motivation
As a student researcher in Professor Michael Roberts' Computational Biology group, I was tasked with creating an EGR1 binary classifier.

## Impact
Provide insight into how other genes expressions impact the EGR1 relapse rate.

## Responsibilities
- Compute which cancer gene expressions have the greatest influence on EGR1 relapse rate
- Build a logistic regression binary classifier to predict EGR1 expression using Scikit-Learn and Pandas on Jupyter Notebook.
- Implement Logistic Regression, Elastic Net, and Feature Scaling.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python3, Scikit-Learn, Pandas
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git
