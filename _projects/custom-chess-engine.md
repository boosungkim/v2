## Motivation
As Chess gained popularity rapidly in 2020, I wanted to tackle the challenge of making Chess and a simple bot from scratch.

## Impact
- Gained a more indepth understanding of the Minimax algorithm and the Alpha Beta Pruning algorithm.
- Helped create a small chess group among friends to test the chess algorithm.

## Responsibilities
- Created a full chess engine with a GUI interface and a simple chess AI from scratch using Python.
- Implemented Minimax and Alpha Beta Pruning algorithms to determine optimal moves.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python3, Pygame
- **Tools:** Git, PyCharm
