## Motivation
Overhearing my classmates complaining about the lack of a convenient method of checking menus, I decided to make a program to solve the inconvenience.

## Impact
Offered an easy method of checking the menu to a student and faculty userbase of over 20 people.

## Responsibilities
- Built a Java webscraping application that collects, formats, and emails the college cafetaria menu to students and faculty.
- Created an fully automated system using Raspberry Pi and crontab.

## Technologies Used:
- **Languages:** Python, Java, Shell scripting
- **Tools:** Crontab, Raspberry Pi
