I am an undergraduate student studying Math and Computer Science at Dickinson College. I am currently working as a data analyst in the Underground Tunnel Detection squad of the Republic of Korea Army Intelligence.

In the past, I worked as an AI research assistant with [Professor John MacCormick](https://www.dickinson.edu/johnmaccormick) on the visualization of Convolutional Neural Networks (Summer 2021).

I also worked as a computational research assistant with [Professor Michael Roberts](https://www.dickinson.edu/site/custom_scripts/dc_faculty_profile_index.php?fac=robertsm) (Spring 2021). Before that, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for several Math and CS courses.

##### Interests
I believe that our world is heading towards a future where most things are run by Artificial Intelligence, from large scale workforces to our daily tasks. My interest is in creating AI systems and workflows to futher human creativity and ingenuity.

Current research interests:
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Supervised Learning
- Deep learning.

Alongside research, I also maintain my [blog](./blog/index.html) and my YouTube channel, [Converge2Diverge](https://youtube.com/converge2diverge). I write about my projects, progress on my studies, and opinions about news in the computing world. Similarly, I create videos about various Mathematics/Computer Science topics.

##### Projects
