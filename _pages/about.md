## Hello!

I am an undergraduate majoring in Math and Computer Science at Dickinson College. I am currently pursuing research and learning mainly in Computer Vision, but I like to experiment with Natural Language Processing, general Software Engineering, and Linux.

I spent the past two years (2021 ~ 2023) serving in the Korean military and plan on returning to the US this fall.

I sometimes [blog](./blog/index.html) and create videos for my Tech YouTube channel, [Converge2Diverge](https://youtube.com/converge2diverge). I love taking walks and swimming.

I love talking to new people and learning about what they are working on, so feel free to reach out!

## Currently
I am currently participating in the VIPriors ICCV 2023 Challenge with a researcher from Yonsei University. Additionally, I am working on implementing milestone papers in Computer Vision as well as recreating some basics techniques in machine learning, such as Pytorch's Autograd and Transformers.

## Recent Work/Research Experience
#### Data Analyst in the Korean Army
2021 ~ 2023

I spent the past two years working as a data analyst for the Tunnel Neutralization Team in the Republic of Korea Army Intelligence. I utilized Fast Fourier Transformation and other military AI tools to collect and process North Korean underground sound data.

#### Computer Vision Research
Summer 2021

I worked as a Computer Vision research assistant for [Professor John MacCormick](https://www.dickinson.edu/johnmaccormick) on the visualization techniques of Convolutional Neural Networks.

#### Computational Bioinformatics Research
Spring 2021

I also worked as a computational research assistant with [Professor Michael Roberts](https://www.dickinson.edu/site/custom_scripts/dc_faculty_profile_index.php?fac=robertsm) on creating classifier models to predict EGR1 cancer relapse levels.
