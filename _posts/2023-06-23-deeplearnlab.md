[DeepLearnLab](https://boosungkim.com/dllab)

I am introducing my newest side project, DeepLearnLab, which is a Jekyll website with side-by-side notes and code implementations of popular Deep Learning papers and tools.

Inspired by annotated deep learning papers on GitHub, I coded this website using Jekyll, Markdown, and Python to share my implemented code.

Over the past few weeks, I've implemented various models from Computer Vision, such as VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet. All of the code, along with my notes from the papers, are now available at DeepLearnLab.

All my Deep Learning studies and paper code will be uploaded on DeeplearnLab from now on. I am currently working on a small-scale implementation of PyTorch's autograd.

Go check it out, and feel free to leave a star on GitHub or contribute!
