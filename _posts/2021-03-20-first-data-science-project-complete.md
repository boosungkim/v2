Yesterday, I completed my first pipeline for the EGR1 binary classifier. I was encountering an issue that was resolved when I reset and re-ran everything. I used Scikit-learn's Logistic Regression model and got an accuracy score of 86.11%.

At first, I thought nothing of it. But when a friend congratulated me on finishing my first ever data science pipeline from scratch, I realized this was another yet another milestone. Yes, I completed Chess AI a few weeks ago, but that was using hardcoded algorithms. The EGR1 classifier is my first ever pipeline using legitimate data science/machine learning tools.

Now that I realize the significance of the result of 86.11%, I can't help but feel a little proud. Even if the number isn't the best, this marks the point where I went from watching hours of lectures to programming hours of machine learning code.

Time to optimize my model!
