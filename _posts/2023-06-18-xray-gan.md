My friend Daesung Kim, who studies the use of Computer Vision in medical research, recently approached me with an interesting paper to get my opinion. The paper was "Synthesizing Chest X-Ray Pathology for Training
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks," and it provided an insight on how GANs can be effectively be used in the medical world.

I admit that I don't fully understand all the details of the paper, but there were a few insights that I wanted to share this post.

## What are GANs?
GAN, or Generative Adversarial Network, is an area of Computer Vision that focuses on generating new images. The "Adversarial" part comes from the use of a generator and a discriminator components in the model. GANs are primarily responsible for the AI artworks you probably have seen floating around on the internet.
