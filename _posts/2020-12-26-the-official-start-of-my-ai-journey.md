For the past week or so, I have been trying to get started with my first Machine Learning project- the 4D Snake AI.

The 4D Snake AI is based off of the 4th dimentional Snake game made by Pella86. I chose this project in particular for two reasons: 1) I really enjoyed the 4D Snake game, and 2) I kept seeing machine learning projects regarding the normal 2D version of the Snake game. I figured that I could follow along a tutorial project about the 2D snake, and I could expand upon that project and build a 4D Snake AI.

Although I had never studied ML before, I thought to myself, "Hey, I didn't know how to set up a web server and networking configurations and still managed to do it. Maybe this will be the same!"

Unfortunately, that did not work very well. Obviously, without a basic understanding of ML and related Python libraries, I cannot complete the project unless I copy the vast majority of the code from someone else's project. But where is the fun in that?

Thus, I decided take my time and learn the basics of Machine Learning. A friend of mine recommended a textbook, <u>Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow</u>, which I will complete before moving onto bigger projects. I tried to at least make a headway in the original project so that I could write a blog post about it last week, but that sadly did not happen. Hopefully I can finish the textbook soon and make speedy progress on my project in no time!
