So far, I've read papers on image classification so far. However, there are many more tasks in computer vision outside of classification. Another popular vision task is "Object Detection."

There are two model types prevalent in the Object Detection field - the one-step models (e.g. You Only Look Once) and two-step models (e.g. the Region proposals with CNNs). Today, we will look at the first three variations of Region proposals with CNNs, or R-CNN.

## Image Classification vs Object Detection

While image classification focuses solely on detecting and classifying one object in each image, object detection requires localization of many objects within one image.
